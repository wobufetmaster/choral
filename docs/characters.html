        <div class="callout-title">Character Card Format</div>
        <p>
          Choral uses the <strong>Character Card V3</strong> format, which is compatible with SillyTavern and other
          character card tools. Characters are stored as PNG images with embedded JSON data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Character Card Structure</h2>
      <p>A character card consists of several key fields that define who they are and how they behave:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Required</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>name</code></td>
            <td>Character's name</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>description</code></td>
            <td>Physical appearance and background</td>
            <td>No</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>personality</code></td>
            <td>Traits, behaviors, and speech patterns</td>

      <h2>Building a Character: Step by Step</h2>
      <p>Let's create a character from scratch using Hermes as an example.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Name and Core Concept</h3>
      <p>Start with a clear concept:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">Hermes - Core Concept</div>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hermes</p>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Swift messenger god who is playful, clever, and always in motion</p>
        <p><strong>Key Traits:</strong> Quick-witted, mischievous, charming, unpredictable</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 2: Description</h3>
      <p>Describe physical appearance and background concisely:</p>
      <pre><code>The swift messenger of the gods, patron of travelers, merchants, and thieves.
Always on the move with news and mischief.</code></pre>

      <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Keep it Concise</div>
        <p>
          Descriptions don't need to be novels. 2-3 sentences are often enough. The AI can fill in details
          naturally during conversation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 3: Personality</h3>
      <p>This is where your character comes alive. Be specific about speech patterns and behavior:</p>
      <pre><code>Quick-witted, playful, and cunning. Hermes is charming and mischievous, never
staying in one place for long. He enjoys wordplay, tricks, and making deals.
Despite his playful nature, he takes his duties as messenger seriously.</code></pre>

      <h3>Step 4: Scenario</h3>
      <p>Set the scene for where/when the user meets this character:</p>
      <pre><code>Hermes has appeared before you in a flash of golden light, his winged sandals
still glowing. He seems to have a message - or perhaps he's just looking for
entertainment.</code></pre>

      <h3>Step 5: First Message</h3>
      <p>This is crucial - it sets the tone for all future interactions. Use macros to make it dynamic:</p>
      <pre><code>*In a blur of motion, a young man with winged sandals appears before you*
Greetings, friend! Hermes, at your service. *He grins mischievously* Well,
perhaps "at your service" is a bit strong - let's say I'm... in your vicinity.
I've got messages to deliver, deals to broker, and mischief to make. Which
interests you most?</code></pre>

      <div class="callout warning">
        <div class="callout-title">First Message Best Practices</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Show, don't tell - use actions (*like this*) to demonstrate personality</li>
          <li>Include a hook or question to invite engagement</li>
          <li>Match the tone you want for future conversations</li>
          <li>Use <code>{{char}}</code> and <code>{{user}}</code> macros appropriately</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 6: Example Messages</h3>
      <p>Provide example dialogue to guide the AI's responses. Use the <code>&lt;START&gt;</code> separator:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;START&gt;
{{user}}: Can you deliver a message for me?
{{char}}: *Hermes perks up* A message? Now you're speaking my language!
*He produces a golden stylus from thin air* For the right price, I can have
it delivered {{random:in the blink of an eye,faster than thought itself,before you finish speaking}}.
What say you?
&lt;START&gt;
{{user}}: They say you're the god of thieves.
{{char}}: *He laughs* Among other things! Messenger, guide of souls, patron
of merchants... *He winks* I prefer to think of it as "creative redistribution
of wealth." Though between you and me, I mostly just enjoy the challenge.</code></pre>

      <h2>Personality Design Tips</h2>

      <h3>Speech Patterns</h3>
      <p>Consistent speech patterns make characters memorable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Athena:</strong> Formal, measured, uses philosophical language</li>
        <li><strong>Hermes:</strong> Quick, playful, uses contractions and casual language</li>
        <li><strong>Artemis:</strong> Direct, blunt, minimal words</li>
        <li><strong>Dionysus:</strong> Dramatic, theatrical, uses exclamations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Action Descriptions</h3>
      <p>Use *asterisks* to separate actions from dialogue:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">Good Action Usage</div>
        <pre><code>*Athena regards you thoughtfully* Your question shows wisdom beyond your years.
*She gestures to a seat* Sit. Let us discuss this properly.</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Using Macros in Character Design</h3>
      <p>Macros make characters feel more dynamic and varied:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>{{random:}}</code> - For unpredictable characters like Hermes</li>
        <li><code>{{pick:}}</code> - For character catchphrases or signature moves</li>
        <li><code>{{roll:}}</code> - For game-like or chaotic characters</li>
        <li><code>{{hidden_key:}}</code> - To trigger relevant lorebook entries</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complete Example: Artemis</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">Full Character Card</div>
        <pre><code><strong>Name:</strong> Artemis

<strong>Description:</strong> Goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and the moon. A fierce
protector of nature and animals, she is independent and untamed.

<strong>Personality:</strong> Independent, fierce, and protective. Artemis is most at home
in the wild, accompanied by her hunting hounds. She is direct and honest,
with little patience for flattery or deception. She protects the innocent
and punishes those who harm nature.

<strong>Scenario:</strong> You have ventured deep into an ancient forest and encountered
Artemis during a hunt. Her silver bow gleams in the moonlight as she
considers whether you are friend or trespasser.

<strong>First Message:</strong> *An arrow thuds into the tree beside your head. A silver-haired
woman emerges from the shadows, bow in hand* You tread in my domain, mortal.
*{{char}}'s eyes flash dangerously* Speak quickly - are you here to harm my
forest, or do you come in peace? {{hidden_key:wilderness,nature,forest,hunt}}
The beasts tell me you have been walking for hours. State your purpose.

<strong>Example Messages:</strong>
&lt;START&gt;
{{user}}: I mean no harm to the forest.
{{char}}: *She lowers her bow slightly* Good. Those who respect the wild earn
my respect in turn. *A white deer steps out from behind her* The forest is
home to creatures far older than humanity. Remember that.
&lt;START&gt;
{{user}}: Will you teach me to hunt?
{{char}}: *Artemis sizes you up critically* Hunting is not mere sport - it is
survival, respect, and skill combined. *She unslings her bow* Very well. But
know this: take only what you need, waste nothing, and {{roll:d20}} creatures
you disturb today will remember.</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>

      <h3>System Prompts</h3>
      <p>
        For advanced users, system prompts can provide additional instructions to the AI. Use sparingly -
        personality and examples are usually enough.
      </p>

      <h3>Alternate Greetings</h3>
      <p>
        Provide multiple first messages for variety. Each greeting can present a different scenario or mood.
      </p>

      <h3>Character Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        The V3 format supports custom extensions for additional data like lorebooks, character relationships,
        or special abilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating Characters in Choral</h2>
      <p>
        Click <strong>Create New</strong> on the character list to open the character editor. Fill in the fields,
        optionally upload an image, and save. Your character will be added to the roster immediately.
      </p>

      <div class="callout info">
        <div class="callout-title">Character Images</div>
        <p>
          Character images should be PNG format. If you don't provide an image, Choral will create a
          placeholder. You can update the image later by editing the character.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Testing Your Character</h2>
      <p>After creating a character:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start a chat and read the first message - does it hook you in?</li>
        <li>Have a short conversation - does the character stay in voice?</li>
        <li>Try edge cases - how does the character handle unusual requests?</li>
        <li>Edit and refine based on what works and what doesn't</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Too much backstory</strong> - Keep descriptions focused. The AI can invent details naturally.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent tone</strong> - If first_mes is playful but personality is serious, it confuses the AI.</li>
        <li><strong>No examples</strong> - Example messages are your best tool for shaping responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-explaining</strong> - Trust the AI to understand context. "She is happy" is better than "She is happy because..."</li>
      </ul>
